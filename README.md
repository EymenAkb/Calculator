# Calculator

This repository was developed by **Eymen Akbulut** as part of learning computing with python.

# Description

This program is a basic GUI-based calculator that allows you to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

The purpose of this project is practice and apply the following Python concepts:

1 - Building a GUI using the tkinter library
2 - Defining functions using `def` and making function calls.
3 - Error handling using `try` / `except`.

## Required libraries

This project requires only one built_in (*some linux versions may not include*) python libraries:

- `tkinter as tk`: for creating the graphical user interface (GUI)

**Note**: Some Linux distributions may not include tkinter by default. If itâ€™s missing, install it with:
```bash
sudo apt install python3-tk
```
Or use this if you are using pip:
```bash
pip install tk
```

## Usage

Run the program in your terminal or command prompt:  
```bash
python calculator.py
```
A GUI window will appear to guide you through performing basic arithmetic operations.
